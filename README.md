# UnderBot
An idling tool for Undertale's genocide route.  When activated the bot moves the character left and right indefinitely until stopped by the user.

## Background
I love the game but I found it a bit tedious wandering around to meet the genocide quota, so I made a bot that would walk left/right infinitely until a fight appeared.  
## How to build
Clone repo and build using the makefile.  It will probably need the relevant X11 development libraries.  
## How to use
Run the program in a separate terminal and open then open the game.  The program will automatically detect when Undertale is in focus.  Once you're in the game press F8 to start and stop the bot.
